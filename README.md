Protecting privileged accounts is never an easy task. They must be identified and managed, but in most cases it takes time and effort to cover the entire organization network. This process is challenged even more in Cloud environments, due to its dynamic nature. Instances (containers and virtual servers) are ephemeral and may be spun up and down all the time, which may cause a situation in which privilege accounts of critical applications and workloads are not managed while they are active.

CyberArk provides a solution that detects unmanaged privileged SSH Keys in new created Unix/Linux EC2 instances in Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments, and automatically onboards them to the CyberArk Vault. Once an SSH Key is onboarded, it is changed immediately. This solution also detects when EC2 instances are terminated and subsequently deletes the irrelevant accounts from the Vault. 

Unlike schedule-based scanners, this is an Event Driven discovery that detects changes in the environment in real time. AWS CloudWatch informs CyberArk about new EC2 instances, and triggers the CyberArk Lambda function that initiates the onboarding process.

The solution is packaged as CloudFormation template, which automates deployment. We recommend that customers deploy it for all AWS accounts and on all Regions.

This solution supports CyberArk environments that are deployed in Cloud, and Hybrid architectures.


# Features
- Automatic onboarding and management of new AWS Linux instances for SSH keys upon spin up
- Automatic deletion of AWS instance accounts upon spin down 


# Prerequisites
This solution requires the following:

1. CyberArk PAS solution installed on prem / Cloud / Hybrid with v9.10 or higher 
2. Cyberark license must include SSH key manager 
3. Network access from the Lambda VPC to CyberArk's PVWA
4. The CPM that manages the SSH keys must have a network connection to the target devices
5. To connect to new instances, PSM must have a network connection to the target devices
6. The expected maximum number of instances must be within the number of accounts license limits  
7. In the "UnixSSH" platform, set the "ChangeNotificationPeriod" value to 60 sec (this platform will be used for managing Unix accounts, and setting this parameter gives the instance time to boot before attempting to change the password) 
8. Dedicated Vault user for the solution with the following authorizations (not Admin):

| General Vault Permissions|
| ------ |
|Add Safes|

9. If the Keypair and/or the Unix Accounts Safes already exist (not created by the solution), the Vault user must be the owner of these Safes with the following permissions:

|Key Pair Safe Permissions|
| ------ |
|Add Accounts|
|List Accounts|
|Retrieve Account|
|Update Accounts Properties|

|Unix Accounts Safe Permissions|
| ------ |
|Add Accounts|
|List Accounts|
|Delete Account|
|Update Accounts Properties|
|Initiate CPM account management operations|


# Deployment  
1. Download cyberark-aws-auto-onboarding solution zip files and CloudFormation template from [https://github.com/cyberark/cyberark-aws-auto-onboarding/tree/master/dist](https://github.com/cyberark/cyberark-aws-auto-onboarding/tree/master/dist)

2. Upload the solution to your S3 Bucket in the same region you want to deploy the solution.(** see note) 
3. Launch the CloudFormation template
4. Update the CloudWatch Lambda rule: 

          CloudWatch → Rules → Choose :  "Instance_Status_Change_Trigger" → Actions → Edit → Configure details → Update Rule 

5. Upload the old/existing key pairs used to create instances in your AWS region to the Key Pair Safe in the Vault 

Update the account User name with  the following naming convention: AWS.[AWS Account].[Region name].[key pair name]
>** **Note:** that this solution must to be installed in every AWS region. For each region, use a dedicated Vault user and make sure the Lambda VPC has a network acess to the PVWA.

# CloudFormation Template 
The following table lists the parameters to provide in the CloudFormation:

|Parameter Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
|Bucket Name|	The name of the S3 bucket where the Lambda is located|
|PVWA IP|	PVWA server/instance IP address|
|VPC |	Lambda's VPC that contains the subnet with access permissions to the PVWA|
|Subnet	| The Lambda's subnet with access permissions to the PVWA|
|Vault user name |The name of the Vault user that has permissions to create and delete accounts in target Safes. (Note: Follow the guidelines)|
|Vaut user password|	The password for the Vault user|
|Target safe for Unix accounts	| The name of the Safe to which the SSH Keys will be onboarded (Note: If this Safe does not exist, it will be created automatically)|
|CPM name | The name of the CPM that will manage the onboarded SSH Keys|
|Target safe for the Key Pairs| The name of the Safe to which the Key Pairs created by CyberArk will be onboarded (Note: If this Safe does not exist, it will be created automatically)|
|Key Pair name|The name of the Key Pair, if it needs to be created by CyberArk (Note: CyberArk creates the Key Pair and stores it in the Vault. The Key Pair is never downloaded to users' endpoints.)|





# Solution Upgrade Procedure 
1. Replace the solution files in the bucket 
2. Update the cloud formation stack with the new template

# Limitations
1. CyberArk currently supports onboarding SSH keys for the following AWS accounts:
 - AWS Linux, RHL AMIs: ec2-user
 - Ubuntu: ubuntu user
 - Centos: centos user
 - openSuse: root user
 - Debian: admin user
 - Fedora: fedora user
> Amazon AMI/custom AMI with a key that was created by the solution or uploaded in advance to the Safe in the Vault supplied in the solution deployment (not supplied hard coded by Amazon)

2. Existing AWS instances (pre-installed) are not onboarded automatically
3. This solution currently handles a maximum of 100 events in 4 seconds

# Debugging
All information about debugging is available through AWS CloudWatch

# Contributing
Feel free to open pull requests with additional features or improvements!

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch
```sh
git checkout -b my-new-feature)
```
3. Commit your changes
```sh
git commit -am 'Added some feature'
```
4. Push to the branch
```sh
git push origin my-new-feature
```
5. Create a new Pull Request


# Deleting the solution 
There is a known issue with auto-deleting the network interface of a Lambda deployed in an existing VPC. Therefore, follow these steps when deleting the stack: 

1. Wait for the following status event in the cloud formation log:
```sh
“CloudFormation is waiting for NetworkInterfaces associated with the Lambda Function to be cleaned up.”
```
2. Go to: EC2 → Network Interfaces
3. Choose the network interface of your stack and then perform Detach and Delete 



# Troubleshooting Tools 
All Instance on boarding status is saved in a DynamoDB table that is located under :
DynamoDB→ Tables → Instances   , Go to the Items tab
All solution logs are written to CloudWatch , available under :
CloudWatch → Logs , Search for your cloud formation stack name
